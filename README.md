# Alpine.js simple example

Just a simple demo of how you can use Alpine.js tp bring simple interactions
into your HTML templates.

Although I'm using npm and a task runner to build my templates, since Alpine.js
doesn't actually require a build step you can just include it from CDN ([see
project page](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine)).
